# Plan

This app will teach me about mongo database, node, and express
I want to learn how to hook up a mongo database to a react application.

The app will:
allow a user to create questions and answers, then submit them to the database
allow a user to view existing questions and answers
allow a user to edit existiing questions and answers
allow the user to create a quiz from existing questions
    The user will start a quiz
    The user must declare how many questions
    The questions are chosen at random from the database
    Question 1 / 10
        Reveals question
        reveal answer button
        once answer has been revealed, reveal next button next button
